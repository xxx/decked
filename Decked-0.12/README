NOTE: I am finished with this software. Filters were not implemented because
the current GUI framework makes them overly tedious. The next version will
have a re-written-by-hand GUI using Gtk2. Feel free to hack on this, and
I will apply bugfixes or patches, should others send them in.

The .glade file is included for anyone who cares.

Let's get back to the program.

Decked - A deck editor/sealed deck generator for Magic: The Gathering written
    in Perl/GTK.

URL: http://mrnutty.yclan.net/~mpd/decked

This software was intended to supplement Sal Valente's Mindless Automaton
(available at http://mindless.sourceforge.net)

DISCLAIMER

Magic: The Gathering is a trademark of Wizards of the Coast (and probably
by extension, Hasbro.) I do not own it. I am not involved with either
company in any fashion. I'm just a long-time player looking to fill in
a missing piece.

This software is NOT an official Wizards of the Coast product, NOR is it
endorsed by or affiliated with Wizards of the Coast whatsoever.

INSTALLATION

Installation is the same as most other Perl modules:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test # optional, but highly recommended.
make install

-perldoc decked- at a command prompt will show you the manual after
installation.

Before running the program, however, there is some more setup required.

Perl 5.6.0 or higher as well as several modules are required. -make test-
will let you know what you have and what you need.

Some files need to be present. These files are present in E-League's Oracle
patch at http://www.e-league.com/index.php?function=download&file=oraclepatch
or from the main Decked distribution site at
http://mrnutty.yclan.net/~mpd/decked

The needed files are Distro.dat, Expan.dat, and cardinfo.dat. Put them
somewhere safe, then set the following environment variables to point to
their respective files:

CARDINFO_DAT => cardinfo.dat
You should have this set already if you use Mindless Automaton.

DISTRO_DAT => Distro.dat
EXPAN_DAT => Expan.dat
These are required for the sealed deck generator.

Setting environment variables is shell-dependent and if you're installing
Perl modules, you should have a pretty good grasp on them at this point.

At this point, you should be golden. Run -decked- at a command prompt, and
run toward victory and mega-super fun.
